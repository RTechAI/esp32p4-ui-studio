**FORGEUI_V2_4_2__GENERATED_USER_EVENT_HOOK_LAYER__ESP_IDF_EXPORT_PIPELINE_COMPLETE__READY_FOR_PHYSICAL_RUNTIME_PROOF__2026-07-20**

## Current Platform Capabilities

- Visual React builder with a fixed ESP32-P4 canvas and browser preview.
- Native LVGL 9 generation for the live Studio firmware and standalone ESP-IDF projects.
- AI-assisted layout, theme, hero background, artwork, icon and Interactive Button workflows.
- Shared uploaded-asset registry with mode-aware Python preprocessing and LVGL C conversion.
- Canvas, browser preview and physical ESP32-P4 rendering parity proven across the recorded milestones.
- Deterministic firmware cleanup, regeneration, build, flash and standalone export workflows.
- Generated Interactive Button callbacks connected to the `95_UserEvents.c/.h` runtime hook layer.

Detailed architecture and ownership maps live in `02_DEVELOPER_CODE_MAP.md` and `03_ForgeUI_Generated_Export_API_Code_Map.md`.

## Current Milestone Summary

- **What changed:** Interactive Button export now produces stable callback names and generates `95_UserEvents.c/.h` alongside `90_Studio_Export.c/.h`.
- **Why it changed:** Exported controls needed a defined path from generated LVGL event wiring to application behavior.
- **Final architecture:** Canvas components generate hook metadata; the export server writes the live and standalone hook files; generated LVGL callbacks call those hooks.
- **Proven result:** Hook generation, source inclusion and CMake integration are complete. Physical runtime proof remains the final validation step recorded by this save point.

## Current Status

ForgeUI Studio generates a complete event-hook layer alongside its normal LVGL export. Interactive Buttons use stable, automatically deduplicated callback names and share the generated LVGL event dispatcher.

The live Studio firmware remains a Studio-controlled physical test target. A manually exported project under `C:\ForgeUI-Exports` becomes an independent developer-owned ESP-IDF project.

## Proven

- Interactive Asset Registry, Interactive Button Designer and Canvas assignment.
- Browser Preview and physical pressed/released image behavior.
- Multi-instance runtime behavior and physical size parity.
- Unique callback naming and duplicate-name avoidance.
- Shared LVGL event dispatch and callback registration.
- Generation of `90_Studio_Export.c/.h` and `95_UserEvents.c/.h`.
- Automatic CMake inclusion of generated UI and user-event sources.
- Live firmware and standalone ESP-IDF export integration.

## Remaining Proof

Complete final physical runtime validation:

- Confirm ESP-IDF compiles the generated `95_UserEvents.c`.
- Confirm button clicks print the generated event name and user-event message.
- Repeat with multiple Interactive Buttons.

Once confirmed, the generated user-event hook milestone is physically proven.

## Next Work

- Expand hook generation to additional widgets such as LEDs, Switches and Sliders.
- Design the I/O tab and runtime action system connecting generated callbacks to ESP32-P4 hardware features.

## FORGEUI_V2_4_1__AI_ARTWORK_NATIVE_PIPELINE__MULTI_MODE_IMAGE_PREPROCESSOR__PHYSICAL_ESP32P4_PROVEN__2026-07-17

- **What changed:** Added independent preprocessing modes for hero backgrounds, artwork, icons, normal images and Interactive Button assets.
- **Why it changed:** Artwork and icons were incorrectly passing through the full-screen hero crop-and-resize path.
- **Final architecture:** All image sources share the upload and LVGL conversion pipeline, with `assetMode` selecting the appropriate Python preprocessing branch.
- **Proven result:** Native artwork and hero behavior were physically validated on ESP32-P4 with Canvas and Preview parity.

## FORGEUI_THEME_MANAGER_POLISH_PROVEN__INDUSTRIAL_DASHBOARD_LAYOUT_PROVEN__ADVANCED_WIDGETS_NEXT__2026-07-17

- **What changed:** Polished Theme Manager asset presentation and validated an industrial dashboard layout.
- **Why it changed:** Hero backgrounds and compact uploaded icons required different presentation rules.
- **Final architecture:** Theme palettes, hero backgrounds and uploaded LVGL icon assets remain distinct asset classes inside the extracted Theme Manager.
- **Proven result:** Large hero previews, compact centered icon cards and the industrial dashboard layout were proven.

## FORGEUI_THEME_MANAGER_REFACTOR__HERO_ICON_ASSET_SEPARATION__HEADER_EXTRACTION__POLISH_AND_TEST_NEXT__2026-07-17

- **What changed:** Extracted Theme Manager from `Header.tsx` and separated hero and icon asset handling.
- **Why it changed:** Header-owned theme UI had become too large and applied hero-oriented rendering to unrelated assets.
- **Final architecture:** `ForgeUIThemeManager.tsx` owns theme-management UI while Header opens and coordinates it.
- **Proven result:** Extraction and asset classification worked without changing shared theme state.

## FORGEUI_V2_3_12__AI_LAYOUT_PROMPT_HELPER_V1__VISUAL_PROMPT_BUILDER__GUIDED_LAYOUT_GENERATION__2026-07-17

- **What changed:** Added a visual prompt helper with dashboard, heading, section and status-icon controls.
- **Why it changed:** Users needed a guided way to form reliable layout prompts without memorizing prompt structure.
- **Final architecture:** The helper composes text for the existing AI layout pipeline rather than introducing another generator.
- **Proven result:** Guided prompts generated layouts through the established parser, validator and Canvas insertion path.

## FORGEUI_V2_3_11__AI_ICON_NATIVE_SIZE_PIPELINE__ICON_PREPROCESSOR_MODE_SPLIT__ESP32P4_PHYSICAL_VALIDATION__2026-07-17

- **What changed:** Added icon-specific preprocessing that preserves native image dimensions.
- **Why it changed:** Icons were being expanded by the hero preprocessor, producing incorrect white-square assets on hardware.
- **Final architecture:** Icons use the shared asset pipeline with `icon` mode; hero preprocessing remains unchanged.
- **Proven result:** Wi-Fi, battery and clock icons matched across Canvas, Preview and physical ESP32-P4.

## FORGEUI_V2_3_10__FIRMWARE_MAINTENANCE__STUDIO_POLISH__THEME_MANAGER_REFRESH__FLASH_CONSOLE_UX__2026-07-16

- **What changed:** Completed the two-level maintenance workflow and refined Theme Manager and flash-console UX.
- **Why it changed:** Fast generated-source repair and full workspace cleanup serve different recovery needs.
- **Final architecture:** Clean Firmware resets generated source metadata; Firmware Maintenance performs the broader generated-workspace sweep.
- **Proven result:** Both maintenance paths, refreshed theme state and embedded flash feedback were validated.

## FORGEUI_V2_3_10__FIRMWARE_MAINTENANCE__CLEAN_GENERATED_FIRMWARE__WORKSPACE_MAINTENANCE__2026-07-16

- **What changed:** Split firmware maintenance into targeted generated-file repair and full generated-workspace cleanup.
- **Why it changed:** A single destructive reset was unnecessary for routine CMake or Studio-export drift.
- **Final architecture:** The lightweight path rebuilds `CMakeLists.txt` and `90_Studio_Export.*`; the full path also clears generated assets, upload cache and build output.
- **Proven result:** The maintenance menu reliably restored clean generated baselines at both levels.

## FORGEUI_V2_3_9__FIRMWARE_SWEEP_PROVEN__FACTORY_RESET__DETERMINISTIC_FIRMWARE_PIPELINE__2026-07-16

- **What changed:** Added deterministic firmware sweep and factory-reset behavior.
- **Why it changed:** Stale generated assets, declarations, CMake sources and build artifacts could survive between projects.
- **Final architecture:** One controlled sweep clears generated firmware state, recreates baseline files and lets the normal exporter regenerate the active project.
- **Proven result:** Factory reset, regeneration, clean build and physical firmware validation succeeded.

## FORGEUI_AI_SEMANTIC_ICON_RESOLVER__PROMPT_AWARE_REGISTRY_SEARCH__AUTOMATIC_ICON_ASSET_PIPELINE__CANVAS_PREVIEW_PROVEN__2026-07-15

- **What changed:** Added semantic resolution from natural-language icon intent to ForgeUI icon assets.
- **Why it changed:** AI users should not need registry names, filenames, asset IDs or LVGL symbols.
- **Final architecture:** Prompt intent is resolved through registry search and the existing upload/conversion pipeline before components enter the Canvas.
- **Proven result:** Wi-Fi, battery and clock requests produced real assets with Canvas and Preview parity.

## FORGEUI_AI_STUDIO_V2_3_3__DEVICE_AWARE_HERO_IMPORT_PIPELINE__1024X600_NATIVE_ASSETS__CANVAS_PREVIEW_P4_PARITY__2026-07-13

- **What changed:** Added device-aware hero preprocessing for generated and uploaded backgrounds.
- **Why it changed:** Original-size images did not reliably match the active 1024x600 display.
- **Final architecture:** Hero images are center-cropped to the device aspect ratio, resized, persisted and converted into native LVGL assets.
- **Proven result:** Canvas, Preview and physical ESP32-P4 displayed the same 1024x600 hero composition.

## FORGEUI_AI_STUDIO_V2_3_0__AI_HERO_ASSET_PIPELINE__BUILDER_THEME_PREVIEW_UNIFIED__LVGL_READY__2026-07-13

- **What changed:** Promoted AI hero output from temporary preview data to reusable ForgeUI assets.
- **Why it changed:** Generated artwork needed to persist, participate in themes and export to firmware.
- **Final architecture:** AI hero generation feeds the uploaded-asset registry, Theme Manager, Canvas, Preview and LVGL export through one asset record.
- **Proven result:** The selected hero persisted and exported as an LVGL-ready firmware asset.

## FORGEUI_AI_STUDIO_V2_2__LIVE_GPT_LAYOUT_AND_AI_HERO_BACKGROUND_PIPELINE__PHYSICAL_ESP32P4_PROVEN__2026-07-13

- **What changed:** Added live AI hero-background generation alongside the proven AI layout workflow.
- **Why it changed:** ForgeUI needed both structural UI generation and visual background generation.
- **Final architecture:** Layout AI produces validated component documents while Hero AI produces images; both converge on the existing builder and export systems.
- **Proven result:** AI layouts and hero backgrounds reached the browser workflow and physical ESP32-P4.

## FORGEUI_AI_STUDIO_V2__MODERN_WORKSPACE__LIVE_GPT_LAYOUT_PIPELINE__PHYSICAL_ESP32P4_PROVEN__2026-07-12

- **What changed:** Introduced the AI Studio workspace for live natural-language layout generation.
- **Why it changed:** The earlier AI engine required a usable Studio surface for prompting, review and Canvas insertion.
- **Final architecture:** AI requests return a validated layout document that is resolved and inserted through normal component actions.
- **Proven result:** Prompt-generated layouts rendered in Builder, Preview and exported firmware on ESP32-P4.

## FORGEUI_AI_ENGINE_V2__LIVE_GPT_TO_PHYSICAL_ESP32P4_PIPELINE_PROVEN__2026-07-12

- **What changed:** Established the first end-to-end GPT layout pipeline.
- **Why it changed:** Natural-language generation needed to reuse ForgeUI components rather than bypass the builder.
- **Final architecture:** Prompt, API, parser, validation, component insertion, LVGL export, ESP-IDF and physical runtime form one pipeline.
- **Proven result:** A live GPT-generated interface was built, flashed and displayed on ESP32-P4.

# About the Creator

Hi, I'm **Scott Forster** from New Zealand.

ForgeUI Studio began as a personal project to make embedded HMI development easier, faster and more enjoyable. As someone who enjoys solving real engineering problems, I wanted a tool that could take an idea from a simple prompt all the way through to a working interface running on physical ESP32 hardware.

Every feature in ForgeUI is developed with a simple philosophy:

> **Build it. Prove it. Flash it. Improve it.**

The project has grown into an open-source AI-assisted embedded UI platform combining visual design, AI-powered generation, LVGL and ESP-IDF into a single workflow.

ForgeUI is built in collaboration with ChatGPT, which has been an invaluable coding assistant, sounding board and development partner throughout the project. While I design the architecture, test the hardware and drive the vision, ChatGPT has helped accelerate development by assisting with implementation, refactoring and documentation.

This project is shared with the community in the hope that it makes embedded development more accessible and inspires others to build amazing products.

I welcome feedback, ideas and contributions from developers around the world.
